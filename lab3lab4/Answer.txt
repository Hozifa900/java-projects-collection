Spring: An open-source framework for building enterprise Java applications, 
offering features like dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming.

Spring Boot: Framework built on top of Spring, simplifying the development of 
standalone, production-ready Spring applications with auto-configuration and 
convention-over-configuration.

Relation between Spring Platform and Spring Boot: Spring Boot is an extension of 
the Spring platform, providing enhanced developer productivity and simplifying 
Spring application development.

Relation between Spring Platform and Spring Framework: Spring Framework is the 
core component of the Spring platform, providing foundational features for 
building Java applications. Other projects like Spring Boot build upon the 
Spring Framework.

Dependency Injection (DI): A design pattern where objects are given their 
dependencies rather than creating them internally. In Spring, DI is achieved 
through Inversion of Control (IoC) containers like ApplicationContext.

Inversion of Control (IoC): A principle in which the control flow of a program 
is delegated to an external component. In Spring, IoC is facilitated through its 
IoC container, which manages object lifecycle and dependencies, promoting 
modularity and maintainability.
